During this project, I explored and practiced several core web development concepts:

How to fetch data from an API using JavaScript's fetch() function

Handling asynchronous code with async/await and proper error handling using try...catch

Working with external APIs (ZenQuotes API + AllOrigins proxy to deal with CORS issues)

DOM manipulation â€” updating text and elements dynamically based on data

User experience improvements such as: 

Disabling the button while data is loading
Showing a fallback message if the quote fails to load
Responsive design using Flexbox and simple CSS styling
Deploying a project to GitHub and using GitHub Pages for hosting
Organizing a clean project structure with separate HTML, CSS, and JS files
Writing a professional README to showcase the project
